## About

This is the front end portion of a Task tracking App built using React.js as part of a MERN stack application.  It allows you to add tasks with a name, date, and description and then it will display that task.  Once a task has been created a subtask can be added to further define that task for the user.  There is also a randomized affirmations banner across the top to offer encouragement as you go about completing your tasks.
